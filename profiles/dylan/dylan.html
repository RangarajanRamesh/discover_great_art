            <b>Introduction:</b> I am a Singaporean, and spent some years in
            London as a History student
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Origin story:</b> I got into photography when I was studying in
            London, in an attempt to preserve and shape my memory of what I knew
            would be remembered as some of the most priceless years in my life
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Favourite photo:</b> The photo was taken during my third visit to
            Amsterdam, which I had intended to be a photography trip.
            Unfortunately, the weather had other plans, and I was greeted with
            unpredictably strong wind and rain, which not only heaped misery
            onto an already unseasonably cold winter, but also threatened to
            derail well-laid photography plans (especially because I had
            intended to do long exposure photography of the canals, which would
            not have been possible in those conditions). This shot remained
            precious to me not because of its technical brilliance (which it
            possesses very little of), but precisely because of how fortunate I
            was to have been able to take it during a brief respite from the
            poor weather conditions. To me, it not only made my trip worthwhile,
            but captured the spirit of a city that refused to allow its lustre
            to be dulled
          </p>

          <p></p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Second favourite photo:</b> The shot was taken in Germany, near
            the famed Neuschwanstein Castle. The conditions were perfect that
            day - the light soft, mist descending into the valley, and snow
            completing the fairytale look. Those were ideal conditions for
            photography - ones that I doubt I will ever have the privilege of
            experiencing again, which makes it even more priceless as a memory
            to cherish in the years to come
          </p>

          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Equipment used:</b> I'm a Fujifilm X shooter, and use both the
            X-T1 and X-H1. I shoot primes, and rely on the Fujifilm XF 35/1.4,
            Fujifilm 23/1.4, and Samyang 12/2.0 for my work
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Advice for newbies:</b> Shooting film helped me immensely, by
            conditioning me to be a lot more sensitive to lighting conditions
            (given that film can be less forgiving of poor metering technique
            especially if you don't process it yourself), and by training me to
            be a lot more conscious of my framing of shots. Most of all, film
            took away the instant gratification that digital cameras afforded,
            and therefore made every shot a much more deliberate exercise,
            especially since every press of the shutter cost money
