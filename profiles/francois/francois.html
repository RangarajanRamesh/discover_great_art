            <span class="badge bg-dark">Landscape</span>

          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Introduction:</b>I am an amateur landscape photographer based out
            of Montréal, Canada. When not shooting, I work as a Consultant in
            Digital Technologies (and try to fit in photography into every
            business trip). Prior to this, I studied engineering, also in
            Montréal
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Origin story:</b> Travelling, camping and nature have always been
            passions of mine, and my interest for photography came after as a
            way of saving and sharing memories. The first trip I carried around
            a DSLR camera was to Southeast Asia in 2014, where I struggled with
            composing images and finding subjects, even when faced with the
            incredible landscapes of Halong Bay or the mountains of Thailand and
            Laos. At that time, I was using a Canon SL1 gifted by my father the
            same year, and I had yet to develop and eye for photography. Since
            then, I've increasingly started to plan my vacations with
            photography in mind, to the point where I now seldom leave the house
            for a trip without a detailed list of locations I aim to visit for
            sunrise or sunset.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Favourite photo:</b> It's obviously hard to pick a "favorite"
            image, but if I had to, this would probably be it, mainly for the
            souvenirs it brings. This image was taken during one of my first
            backcountry camping trips in the mountains with my girlfriend. The
            hike to get to this particular location is a stenuous 10km walk with
            almost 1km elevation gain through horsefly infested forests.
            Fortunately, the views at the top make it all worth it. Our campsite
            was at the bottom of a glacier, which provided us with water and
            dipping opportunities (if you're brave enough to swim in glacier
            water...), and was visited by several mountain goats during our
            stay. More importantly, this was the view we had right from out tent
            as we sipped a hot cup of tea in the evening. From a technical
            standpoint, this photo is a stitch of 4 images shot with a long lens
            to accentuate the shape of the mountains.

            <b>Second favourite photo:</b> A classic shot of Morant's Curve in
            Banff on a bluebird day. I was on a ski trip with friends, and
            decided to get up early one morning to go grab a few images. I
            arrived on location with a few minutes to spare before sunrise,
            hoping to catch a train in the golden morning light. Unfortunately,
            one hour later, there were no signs of any train, and my camera was
            shutting down every minute due to the cold temperature, which was
            well below -30C. While I had a few decent images, I was obviously
            let down not to have the "epic" shot with the train. As I was
            packing my gear in my car, another photographer arrived, and told me
            a train was a few minutes up in the valley and heading our way. We
            both frantically setup our camera, and heard the train's horn
            moments later, resulting in this image from my end (and a small
            frosbite on the nose which I found out about the next day...).

            <b>Equipment used:</b> Fujifilm X-T1 or X-H1, usually with a 10-24
            F4, 16-55 F2.8, or 50-140 F2.8
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Advice for newbies:</b> Only buy new gear when there is a
            specific need you want to fill. It's tempting to always get the
            latest cameras and gadgets, but practically, it won't make a
            difference unless you have a specific purpose for it in mind (which
            is why I do not have a medium-format camera...yet).
