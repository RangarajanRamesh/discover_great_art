            <b>Introduction:</b> I'm Winston. I'm a rising second year MBA
            student at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. I was
            previously an investment banker in Asia. Currently, I'm based in
            Philadelphia. I enjoy including geometry and light and shadows into
            my photography
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Origin story:</b> I enjoyed taking pictures as a kid, though
            using film at that time made it an expensive endeavour. I got more
            serious about it in college. Then, Singapore hosted an international
            fireworks festival over a few days and I tried to photograph the
            displays. I failed, obviously (long exposure, handheld!) and was
            inspired by what I saw on forums. And so I started researching and
            experimenting in shooting fireworks. Eventually, I ventured to a
            number of fireworks displays in Japan. More recently, I went on a
            couple of overseas photography trips which introduced me to street
            photography. I fell in love with it and have been trying to develop
            my own voice and point of view. Philadelphia has served as a
            fantastic playground for me to do so. I recently took part in a
            collaborative photography gallery where a group of like-minded
            artists show their distinctive viewpoint of an "over shot" location
            in Philadelphia
          </p>

            <b>Favourite photo:</b> This photo captures all my favourite
            elements - street photography, frames, geometry, and shadows.
            There's also the element which I term “frameception” - a frame
            within a frame. This photo was a Global Winner of the Sony Alpha
            Instagram Competition 2020 from amongst 16k entries. This photo was
            taken at a void deck - an open space on the ground floor of a
            government housing block in Singapore. I had taken a break from my
            job with the intention of travelling the world, but Covid put a
            premature end to that. Constrained to my own backyard, I decided to
            explore Singapore, spending hours walking through these housing
            blocks in various neighbourhoods. I discovered a different
            perspective, and I fell in love with the framing opportunities these
            void decks offered. Many of them were designed with geometrical
            shapes embedded in the walls and columns. The shadow elements add a
            new dimension to a scene. I needed a subject so I waited, and this
            lady turned to me when she noticed my camera

          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Second favourite photo:</b> I spotted this scene round the corner
            from the apartment building that I'm living at. I like the strip of
            light, the textures of the wall and colour tones. I waited for a
            subject to pass into the light and got a unique silhouette

            <b>Advice for newbies:</b> Find inspiration from different sources
            but always look to develop your own unique voice
