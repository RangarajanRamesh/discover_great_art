          </p>

            <b>Introduction:</b> I was born in India but grew up mostly in the
            UK. I studied Engineering at university and then worked on a startup
            and now consulting. Outside of work and photography, I love to read
            good books - add me on Goodreads if you want to know what I'm
            reading! I don't think i'm at the level of the photographers that
            i'm profiling but jumping at the chance to explain the thinking
            behind my favourite photos
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Origin story:</b> I started taking photos when I was quite young
            (probably around 11) but got into it more seriously when I began
            university. I don't remember why I was interested at first, but it's
            one of those things that I just kept doing especially when I
            travelled anywhere new. I was really pretty bad at the beginning but
            improved a lot by copying photos I saw online and going on shoots
            with friends who were (and still are) much better than me
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Favourite photo:</b> I interned in China in 2013 and really
            developed my skills and my favorite photo is a spur of the moment
            shot I took in a backstreet in Shanghai. I was wandering around
            (probably lost) when I saw a tourist excitedly spot the graffiti on
            the wall and ask the street sweeper to take her photo. There are two
            contrasts I liked about the photo: 1) The tourist excited by the
            chance for a great Instagram post and the street sweeper going about
            his job and 2) the graffiti on the walls with the backdrop of rows
            and rows of newly built flats. I really enjoy capturing such
            unscripted moments and when I look at the photo - its so easy for me
            to jump back into the moment
          </p>

          <p></p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Second favourite photo:</b> It's really hard for me to choose
            just one other photo but this one is right up there. In 2015, I went
            to Greece with a friend and we hiked the mountains in Meteora to
            various monasteries. It was off season and so there weren't too many
            other tourists but you would occasionally get large tour groups. The
            lady in the shot is actually the leader of a Korean tourist group
            that were standing below her (out of frame). I liked the vastness of
            the scene as a backdrop against a strong person standing almost
            defiantly. Again, it wasn't a planned shot, I just took it
            instinctively reacting to the situation

            <b>Equipment used:</b> Canon 5D MK III, 24-105 f4 L II and 70-200
            f2.8 L II although both of these photos were taken using a Canon
            500D with EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 (goes to show the camera doesn't
            matter)
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Advice for newbies:</b> I think the hardest part of photography
            is learning to recognize a good photo. It took me years before I
            could say what was good and what was not (in my eyes anyway) and I'm
            still learning to unpick the photos to say why exactly they are good
            and bad. I think a good way to get started is to copy photographers
            you like and admire. I personally love Steve McCurry and draw
            inspiration from his composition of portraits especially
