            <b>Types of photography:</b>
            <span class="badge bg-dark">Street</span>
            <span class="badge bg-dark">Urban Architecture</span>
          </p>

            <b>Introduction:</b> I work at Imperial College London as a research
            fellow in bubbles and fluid dynamics
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Origin story:</b> I was doing my progress report for my PhD and
            decided to get a picture of some bubbles as a cover photo. I bought
            my first DSLR then (a Nikon D3400), and it's been a few years since
            then
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Favourite photo:</b> Man with smoke - it's from my previous trip
            back home in a park in Shanghai, I had just gotten a rangefinder
            from Hong Kong at the time (new camera, new lens - M10 + 50
            Summicron) so was quite keen to give street photography a go. I
            think street photography is more of a mindset and being a little
            more brave than I was previously where I was taking photos of
            architecture and buildings. This picture was the first image I was
            "wow'd" at how it feels when a few things came together, so it
            perhaps has more sentimental value
          </p>

          <img src="li-1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="..." />
          <p></p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Second favourite photo:</b> It is hard to choose favourites. But
            this one is another one of my favourites partly because the HMV in
            the background has now been closed and so the sign will never be lit
            up again unfortunately. I remember this picture was taken as I was
            walking home to a tube station one Friday night after some beers and
            the waiting cab provided a nice urban contrast to the lights in the
            background. After some moody edits the next day during a break, I
            was then a fan, it shows off two things I like, which is Neon lights
            in London and random elements of street photography coming together

            <b>Equipment used:</b> M10 with 21 super-elmar/28 summicron/50
            summicron/135mm apo-telyt
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5">
            <b>Advice for newbies:</b> Take many pictures at first and practice
            often. "Success rate" is a function of practicing lots without fear
            that they are "bad" pictures and then, after knowing what you like,
            be relentless in creating said vision with more practice. And when
            it gets dull, practice more to find out what is not dull, and then
            practice more again :)
